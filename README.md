Hello!

Thanks for taking the time to consider my offer.  I really do appreciate it.


My primary problem: (Javascript)
    I have the ability to create small-scoped javascript (gsap, etc.) functionality in codepen that works.  
    I have trouble getting all these small things to work togther nicely.

    
My secondary problem: (Optimization)
    I think I need further optimizations.
    Preloading, how to load images correctly, and simplifying code so that pages load snappily and smoothly is outside my current skill-set.


What I'm after:
    Someone to take my existing code and make it function more smoothly / effeciently.
    Help in fixing several identified identified bugs:
        --images don't load after moving to case study page, although they do if you refresh the page when you are there.
        --the main nav overlay takes up space when hidden, so I've moved it lower on the z-index when it's not open, I think this is very wrong to do.
        --refreshing pages with dark mode engage can alter the functionality of the light / dark toggle.
        
        (And briefly explain to me the mistakes I'm making generally, I swear I'll have the appropriate humility!)

    Assistance in creating a few more animation sequences to finish the project.



Thanks for reading!
